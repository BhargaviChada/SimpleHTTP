# SimpleHTTP

It is a custom Javascript AJAX Library <br>
It's working is similar to that of axios and superagent Libraries, but this is a very simplistic Javascript library compared to them.<br>
It is very easy and convenient to use rather than typing out the whole get onload functions while performing AJAX operations.

A demo app.js is added to use and test the library using a fake REST API for 
testing and prototyping called JSON placeholder that takes get, post, put and delete requests 
with arbitrary dummy resources present.
